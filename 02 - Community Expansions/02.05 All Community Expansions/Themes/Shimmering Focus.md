## Features

- [[Themes with Friendly Settings|Friendly settings]]: Supports the [[obsidian-style-settings|Style Settings]] plugin

## Customization Options (Style Settings Plugin) 

**Show/Hide Elements**: 
- Re-enable Title Bar: Re-enable this to have a title bar, e.g. for moving the Obsidian window
- Re-enable Ribbons: Ribbons are the thin vertical bars to the very left & right
- Permanently show the Header Bar: When false, the Header bar is still visible upon focus and hover
- Permanently show the Status Bar: When false, the Status bar is still visible upon focus and hover
- Re-enable Close Buttons: When false, you can close the menu with `Esc` or by clicking outside the menu area.
- Permanently show the Edit Mode Collapse Buttons: When false, you collapse buttons still become visible upon hovering.

**Headings**: 
- No Alternating Italic of Headings: In this theme, the Heading Levels alternate between italic/regular to make them more distinguishable. You can turn that feature off if you prefer non-italic at all heading levels.
- Level 1 Headings
- Level 2 Headings
- Level 3 Headings
- Level 4 Headings
- Level 5 Headings

**Fonts**: 
- Main Font
- Monospace Font: Code blocks, YAML in edit mode, tables, etc.
- Monospace Font Size
- Heading Font: H1 to H5 Headings
- Side Bar Font: Applies to all text in the left and right side bar
- Side Bar Font Size

**Images & PDFs**: 
- Turn off the "Max View" feature: "Max View" makes panes full length and images/PDFs full width when the left sidebar is hidden and readable line length when the left sidebar is shown. (Note:  You need to turn on "readable line length" in the editor settings as well for this to work.)
- Size of Images: Size of Images in % (when Max View is disabled or not active)
- Size of embeded PDFs: Size of embeded PDFs in % (when Max View is disabled or not active)
- Align Images & PDFs to the left: When disabled, they will be aligned to the center instead.
- Do not use Darkmode for PDFs

**Cursor**: 
- Block Cursor: Use a block instead of a line as cursor. For best results, also switch the main font to a monospaced one.
- Use a mono-colored Cursor: Uses a (light purple) cursor, as in previous versions of "Shimmering Focus".

**Longform Plugin**: 
- Main Font for Longform Notes: Font used in folders marked as Longform Project
- Longform Font Size
- Left-aligned text in Longform notes: Use left-aligned instead of justified text.
- No Background Color for Longform Notes: Turn off the slight coloring of longform notes.
- Hide files named "Index.md" from File Explorer: Files named that way are created by some plugins like the Longform Plugin and in many cases should not be touched.

**Miscellaneous**: 
- Normal Checkboxes: Use the normal checkboxes from the default theme.
- No Emphasis of Pandoc Citations: Turn off the coloring of Pandoc Citations [@citekey] done by this theme.
- Size of Popovers (Page Previews): Width & Height of Popovers in px
- Turn off "Annotation Tags": "Annotation Tags" will visually emphasize some tags that are commonly used for academic reading.
